    <div>
        <h3> Peak Time Charge</h3>
<h5><b>Before knowing about OLA’s peak time charge, it is important for you to know how OLA works.
    OLA’s business model</b></h5>
        <p>OLA is an online marketplace for drivers.</p>
<p>These drivers are independent and they are either self-employed (own their commercial vehicles), or work for an Operator who owns multiple cars.</p>

        <p>Like you have an OLA app on your smart phone to book a cab, these drivers have a similar Driver mobile App on their smart phones. We activate the Driver app after a
            thorough check of authenticity and conducting due diligence of the commercial & personal papers of the driver & operator. These drivers decide their own time to login
            to the OLA application and accept requests for rides from customers. They may choose to remain logged out of the system as per their convenience.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div>
        <h5><b> Q: What is OLA’s peak time charge?</b></h5>
<p>OLA peak time charge is a fare-rationalizing rule of using a multiplier X or a flat
    surcharge to the standard fares causing the fare to be higher than the standard
    fare during certain times the day; i.e. if X is 1.2 during some point of time then
    the standard fare will be multiplied by 1.2 to get the final fare.
</p>
    </div>

    <div>
        <h5><b> Q: Why is there a need to apply a surcharge to my standard fare?</b></h5>
<p>OLA being a marketplace doesn’t control the number of vehicles online on its system/platform;
    drivers & operators are independent & work as per their convenience.
    During a normal day when demand & supply are met, there is no need to put an extra
    effort to pull the supply side of vehicles.</p>
        <p>
            OLA has observed that during certain times of the day, when more traffic is on road, routine drivers tend to log out of the system to suit their convenience as there is no incentive for them to put an extra effort. Similarly, when demand suddenly increases, not enough drivers might be available on the road. Customers might be inconvenienced by not being able to find cabs during such times.

        </p>

        <p>
            As a system/solutions provider OLA has limited options to motivate the drivers and cater to the high demand timings & scenarios. OLA has observed that the drivers are very sensitive to little extra earnings for their extra effort to stay logged in to our system.
        </p>

        <p>OLA applies an X multiplier or flat surcharge to the normal fare based on various situations and scenarios like place of pickup, time of pickup, type of vehicle, demand
            situation, supply scenario etc. Using advanced analytics, unique algorithm, past ride experiences etc. the OLA software calculates an appropriate surcharge to apply
            over and above the normal fare. This enables OLA to come up with appropriate incentives to drivers to make them stay logged in to the system for the additional
            earnings. This enables customers to get their much needed service even during peak times when demand for cabs is high.
The peak time surcharge works in two ways
</p>

        <p>The peak time surcharge works in two ways</p>

        <h5><b>a) It motivates drivers to stay & serve for a longer time even during difficult hours of the day and when demand is high.</b></h5>
        <h5><b>b) It filters out the less needed rides hence making the vehicle available to those who really need a cab.</b></h5>
    </div>

    <div>
        <h5><b>Transparency</b></h5>
<p>OLA is transparent about the rates. OLA makes sure that customers are aware of the dynamics of peak time charge and how it works. Whenever peak time charge is applicable;
        customers get a clear intimation, to confirm their intent to avail the ride at a higher price than normal. The booking process is initiated only when they confirm;
        hence, if a customer wants to avoid that ride he/she may choose to do it, thus making the cab available to others who are in need.
</p>
    </div>

    <div>
        <h5><b>Cab Play</b></h5>
        <p>Ola Play transfers the control of the in-car experience to users from the Driver Console, which enables interfacing with the consumer’s device, once
            a ride begins. Customers can experience Ola Play from their own devices or from the large screen devices mounted in-car, along with car's surround sound systems.</p>

<p>This context-aware system uses customer preferences and current ride information like time and destination to offer personalised recommendations during the ride.</p>
    </div>

     <div>
        <h5><b>Cab Share</b></h5>
        <p>TNC is a new term being used by government entities to refer to rideshare companies such as Uber and Lyft.  You may have seen it at airports, as they are starting to label the designated pickup areas (or waiting areas for drivers) with these signs.
        </p>

         <p>Ola cab booking service allows its customers to book Ola share cabs. Ola share cab refers to the booking of a cab with another traveler on a similar route. It is the process by which you can book only one or two seats for a ride, and you will not be charged for the other two seats.

</p>
    </div>

    <div>
        <h5><b>Share Pass</b></h5>
        <p>Share Pass offers the convenience of hassle free daily commute on Ola Share rides with its fixed fares. Travel anywhere in the city with fares starting from as low as flat Rs.40 per ride (depending on the city and the type of share pass). The fare for your Ola Share ride will always be indicated before you confirm a booking.
        </p>
        <h5> <b>How can I pay for my Share ride using Share Pass?</b></h5>
        <p>You can pay for your share ride either by Cash or Ola Money.</p>

<h5>What is the price of Share Pass?</h5>
        <p>The price of Share Pass varies from city to city and depends on the type of pass you choose to buy.</p>

        <h5><b> I don’t see an option to buy Share Pass on my Ola App?</b></h5>
        <p>Currently Share Pass applicable on Ola Share rides is available in limited cities only. Once Share Pass is launched in your city, you will receive a notification on
            your Ola app. We request you to keep your Ola app updated to the latest version for purchasing a Share Pass as soon as it is available for you.</p>

        <h5><b>  How can I turn off auto-renew option for a particular pass?</b></h5>
        <p>You can turn off Auto Renew option for your Share Pass from your Ola app. All you need to do is:</p>

        <p>1. Go to your Ola app menu</p>
<p>2. Tap on your name to visit your Profile.</p>
<p>3. Select Share Pass option and tap on the pass for which you want to turn off auto renew option.</p>
<p>4. Toggle Auto Renew Pass to the left</p>
        <p></p>

    </div>
    <div>
        <h5><b>Cab Pass</b></h5>
        <p>Ola offers it's customers the facility to avail a periodic pass. An Ola pass is the service by which you can book cabs at the fixed fares without
            any peak charges, throughout the stipulated period. This means that it gives the pass holder an advantage in booking cabs for a particular number of rides. The pass service is helpful to regular travelers. It can be availed for a month, with different number of rides.

    <div>
        <h5><b>Cab Credit</b></h5>
        <p>The recent years have seen a boom in the taxi market on account of which different types of taxis have come up. The popularity of taxi companies
            such as Uber and Ola have led to the mini vehicle boom as well. The demand for taxis have been increasing and many cab companies hire drivers
            throughout the year to cater to this rise in demand. Traveling, especially in cities with high traffic has become relatively hassle-free due to
            the availability of taxi services.</p>

<p>In lieu of this, car companies are also offering deals for drivers looking to purchase cars for the purpose of offering taxi services. Banks and financial
    institutions are offering auto loans specifically designed for purchasing vehicles for taxi services.</p>

<p>Here are some popular auto loans, especially meant for taxi drivers:</p>
    </div>

<div>
        <h5><b>Cab Money Postpaid</b></h5>
        <p>Ola Money Postpaid is a fast and easy digital credit payment system from Ola which allows users to pay for their Ola rides and various other
            online services. It is said to be an effort by the company to wean users off cash payments while also doing away with wallet recharge. Ola offers
            this credit facility to the customers without any additional charges and aims to offer its customers a hassle-free payment option.</p>
    </div>

    <div>
        <h5><b>Donation</b></h5>
                    <p> Being a business that is closely integrated within the communities that we operate in, Ola is deeply affected by the people’s
                        hardships due to the calamity. Therefore, we urge you to show your support by contributing Rs. 5 on every ride you take. Every
                        time you donate, Ola will donate Rs. 5. All the donations will go directly towards the Odisha Chief Minister’s Relief Fund and help in relief measures.
